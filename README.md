# KbSpas Web App
I built this app for KbSpas, a retired, GTA-based lash and brow business. I was new to web development at the time so there is a lot of prop drilling (I know how to use Context API & Redux now).

**Play with the app in a dev environment:**
1. Run `cd client`, `npm install`, `npm run dev` in terminal to start the frontend
2. Create a .env file in the root and client folder using their respective .env.example files to fill in environmental variables
3. Open a second terminal and run `npm install`, `npm run dev` to start the backend
